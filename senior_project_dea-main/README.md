# Running our App

## Section 1: Cloning the repo:
* Make a folder somewhere on your computer
* cd to that folder from the command line
* Run git clone https://github.com/erickcgt/senior_project_dea.git

## Section 2: Installing Node.js packages
Start by deleting the package.json and package-lock.json from the server folder.
Run the following commands from the `senior_project_dea-main` directory:
* `npm init`
* `npm i mdb-react-ui-kit`
* `npm install express nodemon`
* `npm install mongoose`
* `npm install cors`
* `npm install bcryptjs`
* `npm install jsonwebtoken`
* `npm install --save dotenv`
* `npm install express-validator`

## Section 3: Connecting to the database
From the `senior_project_dea-main` directory, do the following:
* Run `touch .env` to create a `.env` file
* Open that file and add the following:
```
DB_USERNAME=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
```
* In the `GatorSecurity` directory (parent to `senior_project_dea-main` directory) create a `.gitignore` file if one does not already exist
* Add `.env` to the `gitignore` to prevent login credentials from being pushed to the repo

## Section 4: Pulling in the latest changes to your local environment
If changes are made in the repo, you will need to pull those changes in by doing the following:
* `cd` to the `senior_project_dea-main` directory (if not already there)
* Run `git pull origin main`

## Section 5: Creating a branch
### **All work you will ever do in a repo should be done in a branch. In other words, NEVER PUSH TO MAIN! EVER!**

There are 2 approaches to creating a branch.
### Option 1: Create branch from terminal
From the `senior_project_dea-main` directory run `git checkout -b \<branch-name\>` (i.e., `git checkout -b this-is-my-branch`). This will 
automatically switch you and all of you changes over to your new branch. See **Section 6** for the alternate `push` command you will need 
to run.

### Option 2: Create branch in Github and pull into you local repo
* Login to Githuband go to `code` -> `branches`
* Click the `New Branch` button
* Name the branch whatever you like
* Complete steps from **Section 3**
* Run `git checkout \<branch-name\>` (i.e., `git checkout this-is-my-branch`)


## Section 6: Pushing you changes to the repo
If you've made changes locally and you want to commit and push those changes to the repo, do the following:
* `cd` to the `senior_project_dea-main` directory (if not already there)
* Run `git add .` to stage all changed files
* Run `git commit -m "your commit message"` to commit your local changes
* Run `git push` (If you created your branch through the terminal, an error will pop up with the alternative command that you need to run.)

## Section 7: Running the app locally
To start the backend run the following commands:
* `cd server`
* `npm run start`

To start the frontend run, open a second terminal in the `senior_project_dea-main` directory and run `npm run start`.
